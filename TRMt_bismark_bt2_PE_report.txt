Bismark report for: ./Data/TRMt_combined_R1.fastq.gz and ./Data/TRMt_combined_R2.fastq.gz (version: v0.16.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of ./ref/ with the specified options: -q --phred33 -N 1 --score-min L,-0.6,-0.7 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --minins 0 --maxins 1000
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	250000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	122556
Mapping efficiency:	49.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	117298
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	10146
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	63993	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	58563	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
